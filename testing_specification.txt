Testing Procedure for Solvers:

1) Generate Synthetic Data
	- Intercept free model
	- Deal with normalization ( somehow )

2) Pick an identical stopping criterion
	- Different solvers use different stopping criteria
	- Need to compare using identical criterion

3) Generate 'gold standard' Beta-tilde using boring solver ( BFGS, CGD, etc )
	- Generate figure of merit describing difference between gold-standard and solver under test
	- Possible figure of merit: || Beta_solver - Beta_gold ||_2 / || Beta_gold ||_2

4) Run Multiple Tests
	- Run many ( 100? ) identical tests and generate mean of relative error standard deviation

5) Examine composite test results
	- Mean and standard deviation of relative error both need to be 'small'

Testing Procedure for FOS w/ Solver Under Test

1) Generate Synthetic Data
	- Intercept free model
	- Deal with normalization ( somehow )

2) Generate Support using BFGS method
	- This support will be considered 'gold standard'

3) Generate Support using solver under test

4) Compare 'gold standard' to solver under test
	- Generate Hamming distance between supports
	- Hamming distance of zero indicates validated solver

5) Run Multiple Tests
	- Run many ( 100? ) identical tests and generate mean and standard deviation of Hamming distance
	- Mean and standard deviation of 0 is required for validation
